// WorkHandler is a blocking call which manages the retrieval and processing of work. It should either process all work,
// available, or a single piece of work and return. If you return after processing one piece of work pool will keep
// calling the handler.
//
// Return true if the handler should be called again, otherwise return false to indicate work is complete.
//
// The done signal is triggered if the pool has been cancelled. It indicates that work should terminate immediately.
//
// Where work comes from is implementation dependant, for example: a channel, RabbitMQ, dbus, or any other event system.
//
// Here is a WorkHandler which squares a number. Notice that it is wrapped in a function to pass in the input/output
// channels. By returning after each item it allows the WorkPool to deal with early exits.
//   func sq(input <-chan int, output chan<- int) WorkHandler {
//       return func(done <-chan struct{}) bool {
//          for true {

//              case number := <- input:
//                  output <- number * number
//                  //return true

// Here is another example which ignores the done channel. In this case the WorkPool will manage early termination, but
// will not be able to do so if the input channel is blocked:
//   func sq(input <-chan int, output chan<- int) WorkHandler {
//       return func(done <-chan struct{}) bool {
//           for number := range input {
//               output <- number * number
//               return true
//           }
//           return false
//       }
